Cisco Packet Tracer Lab - Network Diagram

Overview

This is a lab I created to practice network design and configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer. The topology includes routers, switches, firewalls, PCs, and servers, as well as an attacking laptop for security testing.

Lab Instructions

Create the network diagram as shown in the provided image.

Use the following devices:

Cisco 2911 routers (x2)

Cisco 2960 switches (x2)

Cisco 5505 Firewalls (x2)

PCs (x2)

Servers (x2)

A laptop (as the 'attacker')

Connect the devices using Packet Tracerâ€™s Automatically Choose Connection Type function.

Assign IP addresses to each device accordingly.

Configure routing between the New York Branch and Tokyo Branch.

Implement firewall rules to allow secure communication while preventing unauthorized access.

Simulate an attack from the 'Attacker' laptop to test firewall security.

Network Topology

New York Branch: Includes PC1, PC2, SW1, and Router R1.

Tokyo Branch: Includes SRV1, SRV2, SW2, and Router R2.

Security Infrastructure: Firewalls (FW1, FW2) for network protection.

Attacker: A laptop connected to test network vulnerabilities.

Goals

Practice designing and configuring a network in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Understand basic firewall rules and security principles.

Implement and verify routing between different network segments.

Test and analyze potential security threats.

Tools Required

Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version recommended)

Basic knowledge of networking concepts (IP addressing, routing, firewall rules)

Notes

This lab is based on the example shown at 16:40 of the Day 1 video (as mentioned in the instructions). I followed along with the video to complete the setup.
